This is a quizbased game where the goal is to get to the goal in the least amnount of steps in the least amount of time. What we have made ourselves from scratch:

- Created over 100 unique questions with four different anwsers for every questions. Questions are divided in easy, medium and hard.
- Gathered all these into an API
- Created an authentication to access the game which requires the user to either login or register.
- A start page after authentication is done where you can acess the rules, leaderboard and the chance to play the game
- A game page which consists of:

1.  an in game timer
2.  progressbar where you can track how many steps you are towards the goal
3.  questions left
4.  choice of easy, medium and hard questions
5.  displaying the question and four different anwsers. Where one is correct.
6.  displaying if the question is wrong or right and then three buttons if next question should be easy, medium or hard
7.  When the game is over you get the scoreboard with your progress

This was created under four weeks in half-time pace as a final project
