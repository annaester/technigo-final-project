Welcome to  QuizTime!

Let’s go over the basics and rules of this game. 

The goal of this quiz is to reach the goal within six minutes. 

The path to get to the goal is 20 steps.

There is 3 different types of questions: Easy, medium and hard

Easy gets you one step forward, medium gets you two steps forward and hard gets you 4 steps forward.

The max amount of questions you are allowed to answer is 24. If you don't reach the goal within these you game over

You will not lose steps if you get a question wrong BUT you will lose questions! 

You lose 1 question for easy, 2 for medium and 4 for hard.

Don't worry, you will both have a timer, a progress bar and questions left when you take the quiz.



Challenge yourself! Can you get to the goal in the least amount of questions answered  in the least amount of time?
